# Encryption , Decryption, Cryptanalysis of Hill Cipher
We have implemented Encryption, Decryption and Cryptanalysis of Hill cipher, the implementations can be found in respective folders.     

## Running Mode

For Encryption:      
```bash
python encryption/encryption_script.py  
```

For Decryption:      
```bash
python decryption/decryption_script.py  
```

For Cryptanalysis:      
```bash
python cryptanalysis/cryptanalysis_script.py  
```

We have also attached the Problem Statement [here](https://github.com/Singla17/COL759_assignment1/blob/main/Problem_Statement.pdf) and a short explanation of all the files and their usage can be found [here](Requirements.pdf).
